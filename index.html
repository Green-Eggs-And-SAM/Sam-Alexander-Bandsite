                    “We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for

                    drawing board’” <br />
                    - Lead vocalist of The Bees Knees
                </h2>

                <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>

                <p>
                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
                    Francisco, California. The band consists a dynamic lineup
                    featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                    keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its first
                    commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention
                    from their future manager. Having extensive experience
                    working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
                    confident the band could succeed even further with more
                    support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known
                    record label.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining international
                    recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts.
                    New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                    and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
                    hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
                    affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are
                    drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage.
                    The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio
                    album, looking to be released in early 2024.
